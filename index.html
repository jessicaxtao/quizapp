      <p id="intro-text">The following questions appeared in a study done on 
        general knowledge norms among American college students, specifically comparing 
        the results from 1980 and 2012. While the original 1980 quiz had 300 questions, one
        had to be dropped as it no longer has a correct answer ("What is the capital of Czechoslovakia?").
      </p>
      <p id="intro-text-2">
        In the study, students were given half of the questions (150) but here all of them will
        be presented. Furthermore, spellings that appeared close enough to the researcher
        was marked as correct but here spelling matters. I tried to include some common mispellings but for 
        the most part if an answer is misspelled it will not be counted as correct.
        All answers should be a single word. No capitalization is needed. There is no time limit.
